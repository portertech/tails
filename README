Requirements:

  - rsyslog or syslog-ng installed & configured on your hosts for remote logging

  - Node.js for the Tails server http://nodejs.org/

  - A browser with WebSocket support for the client


How it works:

  Tails accepts syslog messages on port 514 (UDP), parses, then broadcasts them to the client using a WebSocket.

  You can create filter terms, matching messages are considered to be alerts. Alerts are under a separate tab.

  Messages are non-persistent and they are automatically pruned.


Next:

  - Streams (custom tabs with filter terms)

  - Multi-tenant

  - Pause & resume tail (buffer incoming messages)

  - Export paused tail to csv


curl -id 'stream=foo' localhost/streams
curl -i localhost/streams --> {"foo":{"terms":[]}
curl -id 'term=bar' localhost/streams/foo/terms
curl -i localhost/streams --> {"foo":{"terms":["bar"]}}
curl -iX DELETE localhost/streams/foo/terms/bar
curl -iX DELETE localhost/streams/foo
