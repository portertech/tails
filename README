Aggregate your syslog messages & filter for those that matter.

Tails, live syslog tailing with term filtering by Sean Porter & Justin Kolberg.


Requirements:

  - rsyslog or syslog-ng installed & configured on your hosts for remote logging

  - Node.js for the Tails server http://nodejs.org/

  - A browser with WebSocket support for the client


How it works:

  Tails accepts syslog messages on port 514 (UDP), parses, then broadcasts them to the client using a WebSocket.

  You can create filter terms, matching messages are considered to be alerts. Alerts are organized under a separate tab.

  Messages are non-persistent and they are automatically pruned.


Next:

  - Multi-tenant

  - Pause & resume tail (buffer incoming messages)

  - Export paused tail to csv
