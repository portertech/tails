Aggregate your syslog messages & filter for those that matter.

Tails is a side project of Sean Porter & Justin Kolberg. Live syslog tailing with term filtering.


Requirements:

  - rsyslog or syslog-ng installed & configured on your hosts for remote logging

  - Node.js for the Tails server http://nodejs.org/

  - A browser with WebSocket support for the client http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets#Browsers_supporting_WebSocket


How it works:

  Tails accepts syslog messages on the default UDP port (514), parses, and then broadcasts them to the client using WebSockets.

  A user can create filter terms, matching messages are considered to be alerts. Alerts are organized under a separate tab.

  Messages are non-persistent and they are automatically pruned.
