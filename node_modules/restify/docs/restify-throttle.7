var ipThrottle = restify\.createThrottle({
  burst: 10,
  rate: 3,
  ip: true,
  overrides: {
    \'127\.0\.0\.1\': {
      burst: 0,
      rate: 0
    },

      burst: 100,

    }

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Restify supports a standard Token Bucket throttling interceptor\. If you\'re not familiar with Token Bucket, see http://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Token_bucket \. Basically, you define a steady state rate of requests per second (can be < 1, so for example 0\.5 would be 1 request every 2 seconds) and a \'burst\' rate\. The burst rate is what a client can burst to if there are sufficient tokens (again, reference the token bucket algorithm)\.
.
.P
Restify supports throttling on IP address (/32 matching), X\-Forwarded\-For (also /32 matching) and username\. IP is appropriate to use as the very first interceptor in a \fBpre\fR chain (or XFF, if you\'re behind a terminating LB that\'s sending them and you trust it)\. The address is checked against \fBreq\.connection\.remoteAddress\fR (or \fBreq\.headers[\'x\-forwarded\-for\']\fR)\. Throttles of type \fBusername\fR are appropriate to be placd in your \fBpre\fR chain after an authentication step (i\.e\., otherwise how do you know what the user is)\.
.
.P
If you pass in a boolean to the configuration object for the \'type\', a token bucket is tracked per client\. If you pass in a string, the throttle will only apply to a request matching that exact IP/XFF/username\. The most common usage is to set it as a boolean \'true\', so you get blanket throttling for all seen clients; you can then pass in an overrides object as shown above to parameterize differently for different clients\.
.
.P
Throttling by restify will return an HTTP Status Code of 420 (like Twitter)\.
.
.P
Note that the interceptor returned by \fBcreatedThrottle\fR is expected to be run in a \fBpre\fR chain; that is it will call next() regardless of whether the request is allowed or denied\.
.
.P
Lastly, the \fBTokenBucket\fR API restify uses is exposed, if the throttling interceptor as written doesn\'t meet your needs\. Check out the source to get a feel for how to use it\.
.
.SH "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
X\-Forwarded\-For should only be used in circumstances where you know the agent "nearest" to your server is sending the header correctly\. That is, there\'s nothing preventing a client on the WAN from spoofing the XFF header\. Really, unless you know you need to use it because you have a terminating proxy in front of your application, don\'t use it\.
